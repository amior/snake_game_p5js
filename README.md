# snake-game-p5js
A simple classic snake game made with p5.js javascript library. Play the game [here](https://amior.github.io/snake-game-p5js/).

This game is inspired by a _Coding Challenge_ by [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman). The game is complete and the code here is different than [Shiffman's code](https://github.com/CodingRainbow/Rainbow-Code/blob/master/challenges/CC_03_Snake_game_p5.js/snake.js). Feel free to report an issue if you find one.
